# RAW Web API

In this project, I create a Web API using only RAW node modules, without a framework. This project was built under the guidance of Erick Wendel on the video [How to build a Web API in Javascript without frameworks](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NxHY14rMPvc)

The project uses the following patterns:
- Layers to structure the project
- Repositories for data acess
- Entities for model validation
- Services for business rules handling
- Factories for instance generation

The project also uses ESLINT and Prettier for code patterns.

## Running

After cloning the repository, run `npm start` to run the demo.

To use the test file, simply run `npm test`

If you want to run in dev mode, you can run `npm run dev` or `yarn dev`

The dependencies don't need to be installed unless you are trying to code.
